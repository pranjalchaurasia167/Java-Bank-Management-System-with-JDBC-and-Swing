*Fast Cash:* Quick access to predefined withdrawal amounts.
*Mini Statement:* Display recent transactions and account activity.
*Account Balance:* Check the current balance of user accounts.
**Technologies and Libraries Used:**
*Java Swing:* For building the graphical user interface.
*Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit):* Utilized for additional GUI components.
*ActionListener:* For handling action events within the application.
*JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):* To connect and interact with the MySQL database.
*MySQL:* Database management system used to store and manage user data.
**Database Connectivity**
The project uses JDBC to establish a connection with a MySQL database. This allows for robust data management, ensuring all user transactions and account information are securely stored and retrieved as needed.
